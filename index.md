### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    Lab 1 is one of my favorites as it is the very first lab we did. It gave me an idea of what computer science is about and what we were going to have to do. It instantly grew my interest for this major as i found it very interesting and fun.

* Lab 5
   Lab 5 is another one of my favorites. We got to use if, else if statements which i enjoy using. I also used a lot of int which helped me understand what int is and how it is used and what it is used for.
   
* Lab 11
   Lab 11, part 2 is one of my fovirites as well. We created our own little game and was fun and interesting. It was one of the longest labs so it really gave me a challenge, which i enjoy.
